# C Programming Repository

This repository contains solutions to a variety of C programming problems. The solutions cover various topics like loops, conditionals, data types and more. Each file is a separate program that demonstrates different aspects of the C programming language.

## Content

The repository contains the following C files:

- `0-positive_or_negative.c`: Assigns a random number to int n everytime it executes, and prints whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.
- `1-last_digit.c`: Prints the last digit of a random number stored in the variable n and states whether it's greater than 5, equal to 0, or less than 6 and not 0.
- `2-print_alphabet.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- `3-print_alphabets.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase.
- `4-print_alphabt.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters q and e.
- `5-print_numbers.c`: Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.
- `6-print_numberz.c`: Similar to `5-print_numbers.c` but using the `putchar` function.
- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.
- `8-print_base16.c`: Prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- `9-print_comb.c`: Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
- `100-print_comb3.c`: Prints numbers between 00 to 89.
- `101-print_comb4.c`: Prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
- `102-print_comb5.c`: Prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

## Execution

All files are scripts and can be run using C compilers like `gcc`:

```bash
gcc filename.c
